## And why it is not a product

In practice, detection logic degrades, telemetry is incomplete, response processes are interrupted, and threat techniques adapt faster than slide decks are updated.

This project is an attempt to document those gaps without pretending they are edge cases.

The research published here is intentionally narrow, occasionally incomplete, and sometimes unsatisfying. That is by design. Reality rarely provides clean conclusions.

This is not a consulting site. There are no offerings, no demos, and no contact form. The work stands on its own or it does not.

Future posts will focus on specific techniques, detection failures, and measurement challenges encountered during research.
