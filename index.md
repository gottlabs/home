**GOTT Labs** is an independent cybersecurity research project focused on studying how threats operate in practice, how defensive systems respond under real conditions, and where theory quietly diverges from reality.

This site exists to publish research. Any resemblance to marketing is coincidental.

### Research Focus

- The real threats at your edge
- Threat technique analysis and documentation
- Detection engineering and validation
- Incident response under imperfect conditions
- Defensive tradeoffs and empirical outcomes
